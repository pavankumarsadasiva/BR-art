                <h3>C</h3>
                C is a procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972 at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system. The main features of the C language include: General Purpose and Portable Low-level Memory Access Fast Speed Clean Syntax These features make the C language suitable for system programming like an operating system or compiler development. Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

                <h3>C++</h3>
                C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles. One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software. At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming, making it a popular choice for developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications. C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for learning and using the language. Some of the key features of C++ include: Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes and objects and to define methods and properties for these objects. Templates: C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code. Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a wide range of containers and algorithms for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code. Exception Handling: C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it easier to write code that can handle errors and unexpected situations. Overall, C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for a range of applications and is well-suited for both low-level system programming and high-level application development.

            <h3>Python</h3>
            Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry. Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc. The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following: Machine Learning GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. ) Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox) Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow) Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium) Test frameworks Multimedia Scientific computing Text processing and many more..
